Prerequisite: 
	Knowledge of basics of Angular 2+
	Knowledge of RDLC report design

Report viewer is used to display the report in RDLC (Report Definition Language Client).
However, RDLC does not have options to include Parameter filter along with Reports as we have in SSRS (rdl) files.
We can include custom parameters dropdown in angular and set the query string to get the report from Server running the RDLC Web form project

Create a new project with web form template. 
Run and see if it is working
Delete the unwanted aspx files as they are not required

You can use other templates like MVC too, but remember not to include .aspx files under Views folder

Import the report viewer control from Nuget Package Manager.
Search for Report Viewer and install Microsoft Reporting Services Report Viewer Control Webforms
After installation, create a new file with .aspx extention and drag script manager and report viewer control
Set the width and height

Create two folders
	Report
	ReportDataset

Create new file of dataset under ReportDataset
	Include new datatable in Report Dataset known as ProductSaleDatatable
	Include all the columns under Select query and change the datatype

Create new Report and include the header and table.
	Open Report Data of Report under View Menu of Visual Studio
	Import the datatable by creating new dataset under Reports
	

Go to code behind and write the following code:
Get Parameters from Query string
Get data from database based on query string

Download and run Northwind database script as this example is using to show the report. Project sample download link is given in the description

Write the below query: 
@"Select O.ProductID, P.ProductName, OS.ShipCountry,O.UnitPrice, 
                                O.Quantity, (O.UnitPrice * Quantity) as Amount 
                                from dbo.[Order Details] O
                                inner join dbo.Products P on P.ProductID = O.ProductID
                                inner join dbo.Orders OS on OS.OrderID = O.OrderID
                                where O.ProductID = @ProductId AND OS.ShipCountry = @ShipCountry"

and Connection string to connect to the database from our application.

Generate report

Run the project with custom link as ProductId=11&Country=France

Go to windows explorer and create a new project using Angular commands
	Include routing (optional)
	Include CSS as styling
	Include bootstrap npm i bootstrap and set the path in angular json as "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
	Remove unwanted codes from App Component Html
	Remove unwanted codes from App Component Ts
	Include variables of ReportSrc first as string and include the hard coded string of localhost to check if it is working
	Include IFrame in HTML with SRC variable and run the project to see if it is working
<iframe *ngIf="ReportUrl" [src]="ReportUrl" width="100%" height="700px" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	Since there is an error, we have to include DomSanitizer 
	Include other two strings of ProductId and Country
	Include a new service to hold the list of product and Country
	Include FormsModule in App Module to implement ngModel
	Include the html Codes

<div class="row col-md-12 pt-2">
    <div class="col-md-4 form-group">
      <label for="Product">Select Product</label>
      <select id="Product" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="ProductId">
        <option value="">Select Product</option>
        <option *ngFor="let item of _jsonDataService.Products" [ngValue]="item.ProductID">{{item.ProductName}}</option>
      </select>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4 form-group">
      <label for="Country">Select Country</label>
      <select id="Country" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="Country">
        <option value="">Select Country</option>
        <option *ngFor="let item of _jsonDataService.Countries" [ngValue]="item">{{item}}</option>
      </select>
    </div>
</div>
  <button (click)="ViewReport()" class="btn btn-primary">View Report</button>
